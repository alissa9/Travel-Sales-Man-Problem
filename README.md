# Travel-Sales-Man-Problem

Algorithm used:
The Hamilton cycle works by finding all the possible hamiltonian cycles
by visiting each vertex once to get the best path and the minimum travel distance 
for the cities, it doesnâ€™t store the paths which makes it quicker to find the path.

How it works:
Initializing a matrix to store the distance between every two cities using
euclidean distance then calculating the total distance by adding the distances
of the different routes of the cities. 

The algorithm works for up to 12 cities in under a minute.
